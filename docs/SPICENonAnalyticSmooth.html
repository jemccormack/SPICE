<h1>SPICE Simulations with Non-Analytic Smooth Functions</h1>    
    
<p style="margin-left:1cm"><i>
This report presents a series of on-going experiments using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-analytic_smooth_function">
non-analytic smooth functions</a>
in SPICE simulations to synthesise signal shapes
(<a href="#SmoothStep">step</a>, 
<a href="#SmoothPulse">pulse</a>, 
<a href="#SmoothPulsesFull">periodic square</a>, 
<a href="#SmoothTriangle">triangle</a>, 
<a href="#SmoothSawtooth">sawtooth</a>, 
etc.) which are free from 
detectable discontinuities, in contrast to piecewise-continuous 
construction.</i>
</p>

<h2><i>Note</i></h2>    

<p><i>
The methods presented here have proved effective in experiments to date on the 
<a href="http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/">LTSpice IV/XVII&copy</a> 
simulators (see <a href="#Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a>).

<!--
In the early days of SPICE, KFlops was the usual measure of 
CPU performance, and I remember having the use of a specialised
array processing SIMD machine, costing $60K in today's prices,
and delivering an impressive 1MFlop! 
Today humble laptops have near GFlop performance.
<-->

<h2>Stitching versus Smoothness</h2>    

<p>
Signals and device models are often constructed in SPICE simulations 
using piecewise continuous functions, but 
the 'stitching' is visible when the functions
are differentiated. A SPICE square wave stimulus signal typically has linear rise
and fall sections, with constant sections between. A circuit
which has a differentiating action will see an
<a href="#B7HiPassDetailFull">abrupt (nearly instantaneous)</a>
change in gradient between linear rise/fall
and constant sections. (The rate of change of gradient
at these mathematical <i>corners</i> is bounded in practice 
by the minimum time chosen between samples.) 
A more physically realistic square wave might 
be constructed using linear sections for rise/fall
and quadratic ends for smoothing in the gradient better with the constant sections.
The quadratic section might be made equal in gradient where it meets the linear mid-section.
However the stitching is detectable here in the second derivative.
</p>

<p>
Given the greatly increased processing power available today compared to that
in the early days of SPICE (perhaps one thousand times or greater), 
is there a way to synthesise fairly arbitrary shapes without detectable
stitching?
</p>


<h2>Non-Analytic Smooth Functions</h2>    

<p>
A mathematically <i>smooth</i> function has continuous derivatives of all
orders. Examples often used in SPICE simulations are sine, tanh, 
exponential and others.
However, even here, for example, starting or stopping a sinusoid or a tanh
in a time-series (.TRAN) simulation
will result in a discontinuity in the first or second derivative.
</p>

<p>
A 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-analytic_smooth_function">
non-analytic smooth function</a>
has continuous 
derivatives of all orders and has the interesting (and very useful) property
for SPICE simulations of being able to start from zero (or stop at zero) with 
all derivatives converging continuously from (or to) zero.
</p>

<p>
Adapting the simplest non-analytic function
to SPICE, define a non-analytic smooth function, f(x)=0.0 for x&le;xs,
smooth start at x=xs, asymptotic to 1.0 for x&gt;&gt;xs.
This one we name <i>half-step, forward</i>:-
</p>

<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
.func Hstepf(x,xs,kc) {IF(x>{xs}, exp(-kc/(x-{xs})), 0.0)}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Define another function <i>half-step, reverse</i> with
f(x)=0.0 for x&ge;xe :-
</p>


<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
.func Hstepr(x,xe,kc) {IF(x<{xe}, exp(-kc/({xe}-x)), 0.0)}
</code></pre>

<p>
Combine these into the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-analytic_smooth_function#Smooth_transition_functions">
smooth transition function</a>, which has
f(x)=0.0 for x&le;xs, f(x)=1.0 for x&ge;xs+xr :-
</p>

<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
.func SmStep(x,xs,xr) {
	+ IF(x>=xs+xr, 1.0,
	+ IF(x<=xs, 0.0,
	+	Hstepf(x,xs,xr)/
	+	(Hstepf(x,xs,xr)+Hstepr(x,xs+xr,xr))
	+ )) }
</code></pre>

<p>
This function can be used to synthesise a smooth 
voltage, current, variable resistance, or a
transfer function (voltage gain, current gain, transconductance, etc.).
For constructing periodic signals, the non-asymptotic nature of this smooth 
function is what makes it so useful.  However the precise shape of the 
transition is not very controllable, for example, if we should require a 
linear mid-section (see later, <a href="#linearshaping">below</a>).
</p>

<h2>Smooth step</h2>    

<p>
Using SmStep to drive a SPICE B-source voltage, 
with x equal to the SPICE 'time' variable, 
here is a smooth step voltage signal (upper plot), 
and shapes of the first five derivatives (lower plot, s1-s5)
of this signal:-
</p>


<!--See SmoothPulse.asc, just using rising transition.-->
<img src="SmoothStep.gif" id="SmoothStep">

<p>(The derivatives are shown with arbitrary scaling as they will vary
greatly in magnitude - the smoothness is of interest here). 
The step rise time is 100ns.</p>

<p>
As well as uses as a step signal for input to an amplifier, filter, etc.,
this step can be used to simulate a soft-starting DC rail.
</p>


<h2>Smooth square pulse</h2>    

<p>
Using a rising and falling step multiplied together in a B-source
gives a smooth square pulse:-
</p>

<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
B1 Om Op I={VR}
	+ {1/Rout}
	+ * SmStep(time, {t0}, {Tr})        ; Rising step at t=t0, rise time Tr
	+ * (1-SmStep(time, {t1}, {Tf})     ; Falling step at t=t1, fall time Tf
</code></pre>


<p>
The following example of an asymmetric square pulse has Ton=325ns, 
Tr=100ns, Tf=200ns:-
</p>

<!--See SmoothPulse.asc.-->
<img src="SmoothPulse.gif" id="SmoothPulse">


<h2>Soft-start/stop sinusoid</h2>    

<p>
Multiplying any smooth function, such as a sinusoid, by the non-analytic
step function SmStep, or the simpler step Hstepf, results in another smooth
function, so we have a soft-start method. The advantage of SmStep over
Hstepf is that after the start rise time, the function being smoothed
is unchanged (since it is multiplied here by exactly 1.0).
</p>

<p>
Starting (or stopping) a signal such as a sinusoid in the usual manner 
results in a discontinuity in the
first or second derivative. Multiplying by the non-analytic smooth square
pulse function (above) gives a smooth-start/stop sinusoid :-
</p>

<!--See SmoothSinePulse.asc for these.-->

<img src="SmoothSinePulseFull.gif">

<p>
The upper plot shows the soft-start/stop sinusoid; the lower plot shows the 1st 
and 2nd derivatives. Start and stop times are 100ns. 
</p>

<p>

plus 3rd-5th derivatives:-

<p>
Expanding the time axis once more to validate smoothness:-
</p>
<img src="SmoothSinePulseDetail2.gif">


<h2>Periodic smooth pulses</h2>    

To create periodic smooth pulses, define a B-source with the
SPICE time variable inside a periodic generator function:-

<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
.func tmt(tm,T) {tm-floor(tm/{T})*{T}}  ; Periodic time
.func tmw() {tmt(time-{Ts},T)}          ; Periodic window, aligned on time=Ts

B1 Om Op I={VR}
	+ {1/Rout}                          ; Scale current to give VR pp across Rout
	+ * SmStep(tmw(), 0, {Tr})          ; Rising step
	+ * (1-SmStep(tmw(), {t1}, {Tf})    ; Falling step
</code></pre>

<p>
Example shows five symmetric pulses, period T=600ns Ton=150ns, Tr=Tf=100ns
(upper plot), with derivatives 1-5, s1-s5 (lower plot):-
</p>

<!--See SmoothPulse.asc.-->

<p>
And detail for one of the pulses in the series:-
</p>

<img src="SmoothPulsesDetail.gif">



<h2 id="linearshaping">Linear shaping of transitions</h2>    

<p>
A limitation of the smooth function examples so far is that the shape of the
transition is defined by the relatively simple function SmStep. A sawtooth or triangle 
waveshape should have a near-linear mid-section. Or we may require
a square wave with a nearly linear rise and fall. How to achieve
this, and yet retain the smoothness property?
</p>

<p>
The answer is to synthesise the waveshape by integrating two smooth pulses,
a positive pulse for the rising transition, and a negative pulse for the
falling transition. The gap in time between the positive and negative pulses
defines the Ton time, i.e. when the signal is not changing. 
The gap between the rising and falling transitions within each
pulse, when integrated, defines a linear section, with gradient
proportional to the pulse constant section.
The integration can be
implemented either directly using the SPICE ddt() function, or indirectly using
an integrating circuit. The latter approach is followed here as
it gave more reliable operation in practice.
</p>

<p>
The SmStep function is used to define B-source smooth current pulses which are
integrated by a capacitor, one positive current pulse, and one 
negative pulse. The example is a smooth square asymmetric pulse with 60% linear 
mid-sections, Tr=150ns, Tf=200ns, and starting at t=500ns. 
</p>

<p>
The computed parameters for the up and down pulses are shown:- 
</p>

<!--
Times are:-
30,90,30 = Tr=150n
40,120,40 = Tf=200n
Ton=325
-->

<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
; Positive smooth square pulse
B2 0 ncs_tr I=
	+ {1/Ap}*{1/Rs}*                     ; Scale for area
	+ SmStep(time-500n, 0, 30n)          ; Rising at t=500n, tr=30n
	+ * (1.0-SmStep(time-620n, 0, 30n)   ; Falling at t=620n, tf=30n
R2 ncs_tr 0 {Rs}

; Negative smooth square pulse
B3 0 ncs_tf I=
	+ {1/An}*{1/Rs}*
	+ SmStep(time-975n, 0, 40n)          ; Falling at t=975n, tf=40n
	+ * (SmStep(time-1135n, 0, 40n)-1.0) ; Rising at t=1135n, tr=40n
R3 ncs_tf 0 {Rs}
</code></pre>

<p>
In practice, a single SPICE sub-circuit is used to compute the
parameters, then output a pulse (see <a href="#appendix"> Appendix</a>). 
The smoothing parts
of each transition are equal in this example (30ns each for up,
40ns each for down), but can be chosen independently of each other.
</p>


<p>
Next integrate using a current source into a capacitor. For the same travel
up as down, the areas of the pulses should be equal (via the Ap and An 
variables above.)
</p>


<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
* Integration stage, using I source into C.
B4 0 s4 I=(V(ncs_tr)+V(ncs_tf))
C4 s4 0 {Cp}
* Output stage
Bout Om Op I=VR*{1/Rout}*V(s4)
Rout Op Om {Rout}
</code></pre>

<p>
This is shown in the upper plot:-
<!--See SmoothPulseLinear.plt in SmoothSignals.asc.-->
</p>

<img src="SmoothPulseLinear.gif">

<p>
The voltages at nodes ncs_tr and ncs_tf (see code listing previously)
are shown in the middle plot. These are used to define another
current source (named B4) which pumps current into capacitor
C4. The first five derivatives of signal V(in0) are d1-5
in the bottom plot (arbitrary scaling).
</p>

<p>
The linear sections in both transitions are 60% of the rise/fall times
in this example. These can be varied independently of one another
from 0% (no linear section) to near 100%. Obviously as 100% linear
is approached, then d2, the gradient of d1, for the smoothing in to 
the linear section will become unrealistically steep, and a
discontinuity at exactly 100% linear.
</p>


<p>
A detail of the smooth square pulse falling edge is shown:-
</p>

<img src="SmoothPulseLinearDetail.gif">

<p>
The extent of the linear section in the falling transition of V(in)
is clear in this plot. Note that the curve is exactly linear for 60%
of 200ns, i.e. 120ns.
</p>


<h2>Smooth square waves with linearised transitions</h2>    

For the periodic case, pairs of pulses repeat at interval T, illustrated
by the following SPICE code:-

<pre class="CICodeFormatter"><code class="CICodeFormatter">
; Relative times within periodic time T for up (+) and down (-)
; pulses.
.func tmu() {tmt(time-{Tp},T)}      ; Zero is at t=Tp
.func tmd() {tmt(time-{Tn},T)}      ; Zero is as t=Tn

.params 
	; Current source into resistance
	+ Rs=1k
    ...

; Positive smooth pulse, starts at t=Tp within periodic time window
B2 0 ncs_pr I=
	+ IF(tmr(),                     ; Stimulus only inside time range tmr()
	+ {1/Ap}*{1/Rs}*                ; Scale for area
	+ SmStep(tmu(), 0, {p0})        ; Offsets are relative to Tp
	+ * (1-SmStep(tmu(), {p0+p2}, {p1}))
	+ , 0.0)                        ; No stimulus
R2 ncs_tr 0 {Rs}

; Negative smooth pulse, starts at t=Tn within periodic time window
B3 0 ncs_pf I=
	+ IF(tmr(),
	+ {1/An}*{1/Rs}*
	+ SmStep(tmd(), 0, {n0})        ; Offsets are relative to Tn
	+ * (SmStep(tmd(), {n0+n2}, {n1})-1.0)
	+ , 0.0)
R3 ncs_tf 0 {Rs}
</code></pre>

<p>
(The implementation in SPICE makes greater use of functions
and sub-ciruits, see <a href="#appendix"> Appendix</a>.)
</p>

<!--See SmoothSignals.asc, smoothsquarelinear.plt -->

<p>
The example is for 10 cycles with period T=1usec, Tr=75ns, Tf=100ns,
Ton=325ns and 60% linear sections in the transitions:-

<h2>Smooth triangle and sawtooth waveforms</h2>    

<p>
Now that we are able to construct linear sections in 
smooth periodic square waveforms,
smooth triangle and sawtooth waveforms are possible by varying the
on-time Ton and rise/fall transition characteristics of the
previous function.
</p>

<h3>Smooth triangle waveforms</h3>    

<p>
The example shows a triangle waveform of 10 cycles, period T=1us, with
80% linear section, Tr=500n, Tf=500ns and Ton=0:-
</p>

<!--See SmoothSignals.asc, choose triangle example -->

<img src="SmoothTriangle.gif" id="SmoothTriangle">
<p>
The linear section can be set close to 100% if desired, whilst still
retaining smoothness, but obviously the magnitude of the higher derivatives
will increase rapidly as 100% is approached.

<h3>Smooth sawtooth waveforms</h3>    

<p>
The sawtooth has a longer, near-linear rise transition, and
a sharp falling transition. A realistic example might use
a 90-98% linear section for the rising part, and a 0% linear
for the falling part.
</p>

<!--See SmoothSignals.asc, choose Sawtooth example -->

<p>
The example below shows a sawtooth waveform of 20 cycles, with period T=1us,
a 95% linear section rise time with Tr=950ns, a 0% linear
falling transition with Tf=50ns, and Ton=0:-
</p>

<img src="SmoothSawtooth.gif" id="SmoothSawtooth">

<p>
Expanding three cycles resolves the integrating pulses (middle plot).
The peak values of the pulses V(ncs_pr), V(ncs_pf) are very different,
reflecting the difference in rise and fall times (950ns vs 50ns), but 
the areas under the pulses (per cycle) are equal:-

<p>
Expanding one falling transition (Tf=50ns) in the sawtooth
waveform resolves the derivatives 1-5 (d1-d5):-

<h2>Comparision of Smooth vs Piecewise Waveforms</h2>


<p>
Applications of the smooth functions described here will follow in 
future articles, but a first example is shown next. 
</p>

<!--See Filters.asc -->

<p>
The simulation results below compare a SPICE PULSE() function with 
piecewise linear sections to a smooth equivalent
constructed using the SmStep function.
The synthesised signals V(in) (green=smooth, blue=piecewise linear)
are inputs to a 7th order Butterworth high pass filter, with
output signals V(o1) shown in the lower plots in each graphic.
</p>


<p>
For the rising steps, the start times are offset slightly so that
the input signals can be seen clearly:-

highlighting better the differences in the response signals V(o1):-

in gradient (see lower plot V(o1)) for the PULSE() step (grey), whereas the quickest
smooth step (red), though four times faster, moves with a
continuous change of gradient:-
